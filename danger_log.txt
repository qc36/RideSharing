01/21: We find that when user registered, they need to input the password twice to confirm it, otherwise they may input the wrong password and cannot login
01/21: We let user to input the password twice and check if they are the same.
01/21: The phone number that user input should be valid, which means it can only be number, it cannot contain the letter, too long or too short, otherwise the driver will not be able to contact the owner	
01/21: We check the email to see if it has valid format since we need to email the owner and sharer when the order is confirmed
01/21: When the user register, we check the email and phone number to see whether they already registered or not. This is because one person cannot register twice.
01/22: When user login with username which is not exist or login with wrong password, they should not login and should receiver a message.
01/22: Add function which can let user to reset password through their register email
01/22: Owner should also able to register as a driver, so we add another register after the user register and login.
01/22: Owner should only registered as driver only once, they cannot double register. If they register twice, the database will have two driver which actually is the same user.
01/23: We restricted the double register as driver by check if this user is already a driver and give a message. 
01/23: All page should be only available to login user expect the home page, if someone who does not login want to access these websites, they will jump back to login page
01/23: A user should not see the "register as a driver" link after they already register as a driver, this link should only be shown when a user is just am owner
01/24: Only the driver can search the order and confirm it, so we add the permission before these views.
01/24: When create a request, the owner cannot set the request time earlier than the current time, otherwise it will become an invalid order
01/25: We restrict the request time by compare it with the current time, and then apply it to the driver search time window and share search window, which mean all this time cannot earlier than current time.
01/26: We restrict the time window in share search and driver search to let the latest time not earlier then the earliest time, otherwise it is an invalid search
01/26: We change the search condition of share search and driver search to be optional, only the time must be filled in, which is aimed to make the search more flexible
01/27: We find that the driver should not search, find and confirm the order which the driver itself is the owner or sharer of this order, because on person cannot be both driver and owner of one order. Because of the same reason, the sharer should also not search, find and join a order which itself is the owner.
01/27: We restrict the driver search and share search to let they cannot search and find the order which related to themselves
01/27: We find that only the user itself can edit its personal information, otherwise it will be dangerous that anyone can edit the personal information
01/28: We avoid the risk above by restricted the edit information only be accessible when one is accessing its own information edit page, otherwise this page will be no found
01/28: We change the information edit page to let only the driver can see choice to edit ther vehicle size, because this information is not applicable to the person who is only a owner. 
01/29: We found that only the driver of the order can finish this order, otherwise it will be risky anyone can confirm an irrelevant 
01/29: We avoid the risk above by check if the current user is the driver of this order, otherwise they cannot see the confirm bottom.
01/30: We found that the driver can only confirm an order when its vehicle size is larger than the passenger number of this order, we avoid it by checking order`s vehicle size before change order to confirm.
01/31: We found that the buttons ¡®confirm¡¯, ¡®finish¡¯ and ¡®share¡¯ on the ¡®order-detail¡¯ page should only be seen by drivers or owners who are related to this order and only available when the status of order is correct.
01/31: We found that the ¡®confirm¡¯ and ¡®share¡¯ button should not be seen when user enter the ¡®order-detail¡¯ page by click their history orders on the home page: they should only be available when owner or driver search for suitable orders by using ¡°search for request¡± (driver, can do ¡®confirm¡¯) and ¡°search for share¡± (owner, can do ¡®share¡¯). 
02/01: We solve the two problem above by using session to check how the user jump to the order detail page (by click history or by search)
02/01: Users should not see the email address of other owners or drivers so that the user information cannot be stolen easy so we delete email from the personal information page.
02/02: To prevent the detail information of owners be stolen (especially phone number), a driver can only access the information of owner through ¡®order-detail¡¯ page of orders that he has been confirmed. On the other hand, the detail information of a driver can only be seen by the owners when the order status is confirmed. We avoid the risk by checking the order status before show the owner information. 
02/02: We found that the owner information should only be shown to the driver of this order. We use session to solve this problem by adding sessions whose keys are the primary key of related orders. So that if a person just type the exact URL of an owner`s personal information in the browser, it will tell that ¡°don¡¯t have permission¡± when this person is not the driver of this order. However, we still can¡¯t protect the personal information of driver side when a person login as an owner and type the URL of some order detail page directly on the browser. 
02/03: We improve the resent password function by sending email to the user with Encrypted Link, which can improve the account security.
02/04: To protect personal information of owners and drivers, an owner or sharer should not access other owners¡¯ information in the order detail page. We do this by only show the owner/sharer information to the order`s driver, not owner or sharer.
02/05: We change the SMTP provider from QQ to duke.edu
